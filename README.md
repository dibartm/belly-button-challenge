# Data Visualization - Bar Chart and Bubble Chart

This repository contains code and files for creating interactive data visualizations using Bar Charts and Bubble Charts.

## Bar Chart

- The bar chart displays the top 10 sample values as vertical bars, with the corresponding OTU IDs as labels and OTU labels as tooltips.

- Chart Functionality:
  - The chart initializes without any errors.
  - When a new sample is selected, the chart updates dynamically.
  - The values for the top 10 samples are used for the bar lengths.
  - OTU IDs are used as labels for the x-axis.
  - OTU labels are shown as tooltips when hovering over the bars.

## Bubble Chart

- The bubble chart displays the relationships between OTU IDs, sample values, marker colors, and marker sizes.

- Chart Functionality:
  - The chart initializes without any errors.
  - When a new sample is selected, the chart updates dynamically.
  - OTU IDs are used for the x-axis values.
  - Sample values are used for the y-axis values.
  - OTU IDs are also used for marker colors.
  - Sample values are used to determine the size of the markers.
  - OTU labels are displayed as text values on the markers.

## Metadata and Deployment

- Metadata:
  - The metadata section of the application initializes without any errors.
  - When a new sample is selected, the metadata updates accordingly.

- Deployment:
  - The application has been successfully deployed to GitHub Pages for easy access and sharing.
